              <h3>Coffee Arabica</h3>
              <p>Arabica is the most popular type of coffee, Arabica beans have a sweeter, more complex flavor that you can drink straight. Compared to Robusta, Arabica tends to have more acidity, less caffeine, and smoother taste. However, the distinctive flavor of Arabica coffee might change when it is brewed cold or with crema.  Arabica is the finest quality of the coffee bean. The growing conditions of the plant and the amazing flavor of this coffee species makes it more expensive than all other coffee species. Coffee shops typically use arabica bean blends to serve the consumers with the best quality flavorful coffee. The origin of Arabica Coffee is the highlands of present Ethiopia (formerly the kingdom of Kefa). It was then consumed by the Oromo tribe as a stimulant. But coffee arabica was named after this species and has got its popularity in Yemen and lower Arab. Now Arabica is regarded as the most consumed coffee bean ( about or above 60%) throughout the world.</p>
